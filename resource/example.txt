A Lens s t a b is a purely functional reference

While a Traversal could be used for Getting like a valid Fold it wasn't a valid Getter as Applicative wasn't a superclass of Gettable

Functor however is the superclass of both

Every Lens is a valid Setter

Every Lens can be used for Getting like a Fold that doesn't use the Applicative or Gettable

Every Lens is a valid Traversal that only uses the Functor part of the Applicative it is supplied

Every Lens can be used for Getting like a valid Getter since Functor is a superclass of Gettable

Since every Lens can be used for Getting like a valid Getter it follows that it must view exactly one element in the structure

The Lens laws follow from this property and the desire for it to act like a Traversable when used as a Traversal

In the examples below getter and setter are supplied as example getters and setters and are not actual functions supplied by this package
